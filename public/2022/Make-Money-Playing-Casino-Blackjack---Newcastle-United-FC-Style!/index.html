Not only does it require a good mix of skill and luck, but it’s also relatively simple to learn – making it perfect for new players.</p>
<p>But what if we told you there was a way to make money playing blackjack, just like your favourite soccer team? Newcastle United FC have nailed the art of making money from casino blackjack and now you can too!</p>
<p>Here are our top tips for how to make money playing casino blackjack:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Start by choosing a good blackjack strategy. This is essential if you want to make money playing blackjack. There are plenty of different strategies to choose from, so take your time and find one that suits you.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Once you’ve chosen a strategy, practice until you know it inside out. This is key if you want to be successful at making money from blackjack. The better you know your strategy, the more likely you are to win.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Get comfortable with basic blackjack maths. Again, this is essential if you want to make money from casino blackjack. You need to know when to hit and when to stand, and how much to bet in order to maximise your profits.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Find a reputable online casino that offers good blackjack odds. Not all casinos are created equal when it comes to blackjack – some offer better odds than others. Do your research before signing up with any casino site and make sure their blackjack games are favourable for players.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gamble responsibly! We cannot emphasise this enough – gambling should always be seen as entertainment, not as a way to earn a living. If you find yourself losing control over your betting behaviour, then it’s time to stop playing for the day (or week). Gambling addiction can be very harmful both mentally and financially, so always gamble responsibly!</p>

<p>Introducing Newcastle United FC’s blackjack strategy guide!</p>
<p>We’ll take you through everything from the basics of the game to more advanced tips and tricks, to help you win big at casino blackjack. So whether you’re a complete beginner or an experienced player, read on for all the advice you need.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the basics. Blackjack is a card game played against the dealer. The aim is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over. Cards numbered 2-10 are worth their face value, while face cards (jacks, queens and kings) are worth 10 points each. An ace can be worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on what will make your hand stronger.</p>
<p>The game begins with both players and the dealer receiving two cards each. The player’s cards are face up, while the dealer’s cards are face down. In order to win, your hand must be stronger than the dealer’s hand - without going bust (going over 21).</p>
<p>If your first two cards add up to 21 (called a “blackjack”), you automatically win unless the dealer has also drawn a blackjack. If your two cards are equal in value (a “push”), neither player wins nor loses money. If your first two cards total more than 21 (a “bust”), you automatically lose regardless of what the dealer does.</p>
<p>So now that you know how to play, let’s take a look at some of our top tips for winning at casino blackjack:</p>
<p>#1 - Pay attention to the rules! Each casino may have slightly different rules governing how they deal with blackjacks and ties etc., so it’s important to familiarise yourself with these before playing. For example, some casinos may payout on blackjacks at 3&#x2F;2 odds (meaning you’d get $15 for every $10 bet), while others may only payout at even money ($10 for every $10 bet). Likewise, some casinos may allow players to double down after splitting pairs, while others may not. Know the rules before playing so you don’t get caught out later on!</p>
<p>#2 - Stick to basic strategy! This might sound boring but it really works! Basic strategy is a set of guidelines that tells you exactly what moves to make based on the cards you’re dealt. It takes into account things like whether or not it’s worth doubling down or splitting pairs etc., so by using it you can minimise your risk of losing money. You can find free basic strategy charts online or in books such as Lawrence Revere’s classic “Playing Blackjack as a Business”.</p>
<p>#3 - Use a betting system! A betting system is basically a plan for how much money you’ll bet on each hand and when you’ll stop playing. There are loads of different systems out there but one of our favourites is The Martingale System which simply involves increasing your bet by one unit after every loss until you win. Then you reset back to your original bet amount and start again. This system ensures that you’ll always make at least a small profit in the end, no matter how many losses occur along the way. Give it a try next time you hit the casino floor!</p>
