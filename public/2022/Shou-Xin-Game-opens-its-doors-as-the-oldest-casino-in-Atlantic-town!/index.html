It is believed to have originated from the ancient kingdom of Qin and was popular among scholars and intellectuals of the era.</p>
<p>The game is played on a rectangular board with a grid of squares, each player controlling a set of 15 pieces. In the simplest form of the game, players take turns moving their pieces across the board, attempting to capture their opponent’s pieces by trapping them between two of their own pieces. The game can be complexed by adding various rule variations, such as restrictions on which squares can be moved to, or allowing players to exchange pieces.</p>
<p>Today, the Shou-Xin Game remains popular in China and other East Asian countries, where it is often considered an important part of Chinese culture. There are many competitive tournaments held each year, with the best players often competing for prize money totaling thousands of dollars.</p>
