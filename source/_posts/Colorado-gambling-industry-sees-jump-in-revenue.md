#  Colorado gambling industry sees jump in revenue

# The gambling industry in Colorado has seen a jump in revenue recently, with the Colorado Lottery reporting a $1.07 billion increase in ticket sales from fiscal year 2016 to 2017. This is due in part to the legalization of casino gambling in the state in 2013, as well as an increase in the number of casinos operating in Colorado.

# The state’s casinos took in $732 million in gross gaming revenue in fiscal year 2017, up from $665 million the year before. This has led to increased tax revenue for the state, with over $100 million collected by the Colorado government from casino taxes in fiscal year 2017.

# The jump in revenue has also led to increased employment opportunities in the gambling industry. There are now just over 16,000 people employed by Colorado casinos, up from 14,500 a few years ago. This has helped to boost the economy of the state, with nearly $600 million being spent by casino employees and their families annually.

# While there have been some concerns that the growth of the casino industry could lead to problems such as addiction and crime, it appears that so far these have not been major issues. The majority of Coloradans seem to enjoy having more options for gambling, and it looks like the industry is only going to continue growing in the years ahead.

#  Colorado gambling industry cashing in on new sports betting options

DENVER — Since the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for states to legalize sports betting last year, Colorado has been working to catch up. But it’s been a slow process, in part because of the state’s complex and restrictive gambling laws.

Still, there are now a number of ways to bet on sports in Colorado, and industry analysts say that is starting to pay off.

The Denver Post recently reported that the state’s gambling industry generated $1.8 billion in revenue in 2018, a 6 percent increase over the previous year. Much of that growth was attributed to new sports betting options.

At least six casinos in Colorado now offer sports betting, including three tribal casinos and three commercial casinos. The statewide total for sports bets last year was $517 million, more than double the amount from 2017.

The tribal casinos have seen the biggest growth so far; their take on sports bets went from about $5 million in 2017 to almost $48 million last year. That accounted for nearly 10 percent of the tribes’ total gambling revenue in 2018.

Colorado has been slow to adopt sports betting because its gambling laws are among the most complex and restrictive in the country. The main reason is that casino gambling is outlawed except on Indian reservations, and only a handful of tribes have gaming agreements with the state.

That leaves most of the state’s 121 racetracks and 43 casinos without any legal gambling options. In fact, Coloradans account for nearly one-third of all illegal casino gambling nationwide, according to one study.

But things may be starting to change. The legislature is considering a bill that would allow limited casino gambling at racetracks, and another proposal would allow online poker and other games of chance (but not casino games).

If either of those bills passes, it could open up the market for even more types of gambling in Colorado — including online sports betting.

#  Gambling in Colorado seeing a jump in popularity

Gambling in Colorado is seeing a jump in popularity as more people look to gamble and try their luck. The amount of money wagered on gambling increased by $22 million in 2017, and is only projected to continue rising. While casinos have been around in Colorado for some time, recent changes in the law have made gambling more accessible and popular, with new options such as sports betting and online gambling.

Some people are concerned that the increasing popularity of gambling will lead to addiction and other negative consequences, but others argue that gambling can be fun and can provide a way to make money. Whatever your opinion on gambling, it is clear that it is becoming an increasingly big part of Colorado's economy.

#  Colorado casinos seeing a jump in visitors

There’s no question that casino gambling is on the rise in the United States. According to a report by The Economist, casino revenues have increased by 5.7% since 2016. Much of this growth is being driven by states that have recently legalized gambling, including New York and Illinois.

But what about states that have been allowing casino gambling for longer? A recent report from the Colorado Department of Revenue shows that casino visits are on the rise in Colorado as well. In the fiscal year 2017-2018, Colorado casinos saw a jump in visitors, with a total of 15.8 million people visiting casinos during the year. This was an increase of 1 million people from the previous fiscal year.

What’s driving this growth? There are likely several factors at play. For one thing, Colorado has been steadily legalizing new forms of gambling in recent years, including sports betting and online poker. And with more people now able to gamble legally, it’s likely that more people are visiting casinos in Colorado as well.

Another factor may be the improving economy. As unemployment rates decline and wages grow, more people have money to spend on leisure activities like casino gambling. And finally, it’s possible that the increasing popularity of poker and other card games is helping to drive traffic to Colorado casinos.

Whatever the reasons may be, it’s clear that casinos in Colorado are seeing more visitors than ever before. If you’re looking for a fun night out, a trip to your local Colorado casino is definitely worth considering.

In Colorado, the gambling industry is seeing an increase in revenue. This is due in part to the legalization of sports betting in the state. The Colorado Gambling Industry Association reports that the state’s casinos brought in more than $1.3 billion in revenue in 2018. This is a 5% increase from 2017.

The legalization of sports betting has been a boon for the state’s gambling industry. Bettors can now place bets on sporting events at casinos and online sportsbooks. This has drawn new gamblers to the state’s casinos. In addition, it has allowed existing gamblers to bet on more games. This has led to an increase in profits for casinos.

The growth of the gambling industry is also benefiting the state’s economy. The Colorado Gambling Industry Association reports that the industry employs more than 16,000 people in the state. These jobs are spread out across a variety of positions, including gaming dealers, casino managers, and software engineers. In addition, the industry pays more than $600 million in wages annually.

The growth of Colorado’s gambling industry highlights the benefits of legalizing sports betting. It has allowed casinos to bring in more revenue and create jobs in the process. It will be interesting to see if other states follow Colorado’s lead and legalize sports betting in order to stimulate their economies
