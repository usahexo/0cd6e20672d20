#  Seattle Sounders Return to MLS Cup Final

After a dominant 5-0 victory over the Colorado Rapids in the Western Conference Championship, the Seattle Sounders are returning to MLS Cup final for the second consecutive year.

Seattle was led by striker Will Bruin, who recorded a hat-trick in the first leg of the conference semifinal. The Sounders then added two more goals in the return leg to eliminate Houston Dynamo from the playoffs.

Now they face Toronto FC, who are appearing in their first MLS Cup final. Toronto advanced to the championship game after a dramatic 7-5 aggregate victory over Montreal Impact.

This will be the first MLS Cup final to feature two Canadian teams.

#  Atlanta United Win First MLS Cup in Dramatic Fashion

In the first ever MLS Cup championship game, Atlanta United became the champions in dramatic fashion. The game went into extra time after a 0-0 draw in regulation, and then Atlanta United scored the golden goal in the 107th minute to win the cup. This was their first season in the MLS, and they showed that they are a force to be reckoned with.

Atlanta United is a team that was built for success. They have some of the best players in the league, including Miguel Almiron, Josef Martinez, and Julian Gressel. They also have an experienced coach in Tata Martino.

This season has been a magical one for Atlanta United. They set a new MLS record for most points in a season, and they also won the Supporters’ Shield. In addition to that, they made it all the way to the MLS Cup championship game.

On Saturday night, they faced off against the Portland Timbers in front of a sold out crowd of over 73,000 fans at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. The first half was dominated by Portland, as they had several chances to score but couldn’t find the net.

The second half was a different story though. Atlanta United started to dominate possession and create chances of their own. In extra time, Martinez finally broke through and scored the golden goal to win the cup. This was an epic victory for Atlanta United and their fans!

#  Toronto FC Miss Out on Historic Treble After Falling to Atlanta United

Toronto FC’s Cinderella season came to an end on Sunday night as they fell to Atlanta United in the MLS Cup. The Reds were vying for their first-ever treble, but fell just short as they lost 2-1 in front of a packed Mercedes-Benz Stadium.

The home side got off to a great start, taking a 1-0 lead in the first half. But Toronto FC quickly equalized after the break and looked like they would go on to win their second consecutive MLS Cup. However, Atlanta United striker Josef Martinez was able to score late in the game to clinch the title for his team.

It was a disappointing end to an otherwise excellent season for Toronto FC. They won the Supporters Shield with the best record in the league, and then went on to beat Columbus Crew SC and Seattle Sounders in convincing fashion en route to the MLS Cup final.

Despite their loss on Sunday night, Toronto FC have still had an incredibly successful year. They have firmly established themselves as one of the top clubs in MLS, and should be among the favourites for next year’s championship.

#  LAFC Earn Second Place in Western Conference Despite Early Struggles

The Los Angeles Football Club had a hot start to the season, but they have since cooled off and are now in second place in the Western Conference.

Although they have had their struggles as of late, they still sit in a playoff spot and are looking to make a run in the postseason.

In their first six matches of the season, LAFC went 5-1-0 and outscored their opponents 14-6. They then went on to lose four consecutive matches, but picked up points in their last two matches to move up to second place.

Despite their recent struggles, LAFC has been one of the most dominant teams in MLS this season. They currently lead the league with 54 shots on target, while also averaging 15.8 shots per match.

Their offense has been led by Carlos Vela, who has scored eight goals and added eight assists this season. He is currently second in MLS in scoring and is a major reason why LAFC has been so successful this year.

 Defensively, LAFC has also been strong, allowing just 24 goals this season. In goal, Tyler Miller has been impressive, registering five shutouts and a 1.14 Goals Against Average (GAA).

If LAFC can get back to their early season form, they will be tough to beat in the playoffs. They have a very strong squad that can compete with anyone in MLS.

#  Sporting Kansas City and the Columbus Crew Battle to a Draw in the Season Finale

 Sporting Kansas City and the Columbus Crew battled to a 0-0 draw in the season finale at Children’s Mercy Park on Sunday afternoon.

With the result, Sporting KC (15-8-13, 58 points) finished second in the overall standings, one point behind Eastern Conference champion Atlanta United FC. Columbus Crew (14-14-8, 50 points) ended up in fifth place in the East.

Sporting KC manager Peter Vermes made one change to the team that beat the Chicago Fire 3-2 last weekend, inserting Ike Opara into central defense in place of suspended Matt Besler. It was Opara’s first start since Aug. 5 due to a left Achilles tendon injury.

In the ninth minute, goalkeeper Tim Melia was called upon to make a diving save on a Federico Higuain free kick from outside the penalty area. A few minutes later, Melia denied Gyasi Zardes with another diving stop.

Zardes had another good chance in the 26th minute but headed wide from close range after getting on the end of a cross from Pedro Santos.

Sporting KC came close to taking the lead early in the second half when Diego Rubio‘s header hit the crossbar following a corner kick from Ilie Sanchez.

The best opportunity of the match for either side came in stoppage time as substitute Yohan Croizet put a shot wide from inside the six-yard box after being sent through by Gerso Fernandes.
