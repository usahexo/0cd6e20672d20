#  How many reels are there in the game?

There are three reels in the game, and players can bet one to three coins on each spin. The payout table shows how much players can win based on the number of coins they bet and the symbols that appear on the reels.

#  What is the number of possible winning combinations?

There are 10 different spots on a roulette wheel that can be black or red. That means there are two possible colors for any given spot. There are 18 numbers on the roulette wheel. So, if you bet on a single color, there are 18 possible winning combinations.

If you bet on a particular number, there is only one winning combination. But, if you bet on a range of numbers (like 1-18), then there are 18 different combinations that could win.

#  What are the symbols that appear on the reels?

Anyone who has ever played a slot machine knows that they typically have three or five reels with symbols on them. What many people don't know, however, is what all of those symbols mean. In this article, we will take a look at some of the most common reel symbols and what they represent.

First and foremost, we have the classic BAR symbol. This is probably one of the most well-known reel symbols out there and it stands for "bar" in slang terms. Other popular symbols include the lemon, cherry, Bell, 7s, and diamond. While the meanings of some of these symbols may be self-explanatory, others can be a bit more cryptic.

For example, the Bell symbol often indicates a bonus round in which players can win extra prizes. The 7s are commonly associated with big payouts, while the diamond is often seen as the most valuable symbol on the reels. As you can see, there's a lot to learn about slot machine symbols!

If you're looking to try your hand at some slots games, be sure to familiarize yourself with all of these different symbols so that you know what to look for when playing. Who knows – maybe you'll hit the jackpot with one of these icons!

#  What is the maximum bet amount?

The maximum bet amount is the maximum amount you are allowed to bet in a single game. This varies depending on the casino and the table limit, but is typically set at around £1000 or $1000.
