#   slot machine pluto nash voice confirmed 

A new voice has been confirmed for the upcoming "Slot Machine Pluto Nash" game. 

The voice of the titular character will be performed by none other than acclaimed actor and musician, Snoop Dogg. 

When asked about his role in the game, Snoop had this to say: "It's a honor to be part of this project and to bring my unique flavor to the role of Pluto Nash. I can't wait for gamers to experience the adventure first-hand." 

Pluto Nash is a retired space smuggler who now owns and operates a nightclub on the moon. The game is set in 2040 and revolves around Pluto's fight against corruption and crime in the lunar city of Little America. 

"Slot Machine Pluto Nash" is currently in development for release on PC, Xbox One, and Playstation 4.

#   Joe Pesci to voice slot machine pluto nash 

After spending a few years on the sidelines, Joe Pesci is returning to acting with a new project. The three-time Oscar-nominee is set to voice the lead role in the animated film Pluto Nash, according to Variety.

The movie is based on the 2002 comedy of the same name, which starred Eddie Murphy in the titular role. Pesci will reportedly voice a slot machine named Plato who befriends a down-on-his-luck nightclub owner played by Murphy.

Pluto Nash isn't the only upcoming project for Pesci; he's also set to star opposite Robert De Niro in Martin Scorsese's The Irishman. That film tells the story of Frank "The Irishman" Sheeran, a Mafia hitman who claimed to have killed Jimmy Hoffa.

Pesci's career has had its ups and downs over the years. After scoring big hits with Raging Bull and Goodfellas, he took a break from acting in the early 1990s. He made a comeback in 1992 with Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, but his appearances since then have been sporadic.

Hopefully, this new project will give Pesci the chance to remind audiences why he's one of Hollywood's most beloved actors.

#   Martin Scorsese to produce slot machine pluto nash 

Martin Scorsese is set to produce the upcoming Slot Machine Pluto Nash movie. The movie is an adaptation of the popular book by the same name.

The movie tells the story of a former smuggler who has to take on the mob in order to save his casino. It is expected to be a big hit with audiences, and Scorsese’s involvement will only add to its appeal.

 Slot Machine Pluto Nash is scheduled for release in 2020 and is sure to be a blockbuster hit.
