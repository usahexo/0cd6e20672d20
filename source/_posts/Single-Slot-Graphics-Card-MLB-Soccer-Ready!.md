#  Single Slot Graphics Card MLB Soccer Ready!

The market for graphics cards is constantly changing with new models and releases. It can be difficult to determine what the best option is for your needs. This article will compare and contrast two popular single slot graphics cards on the market today: The Radeon RX 480 and the GeForce GTX 1050.

Both of these cards are great for general use and have sufficient power to run most games at medium to high settings. However, some key differences remain that may make one better suited for your specific needs.

The Radeon RX 480 has 8GB of GDDR5 memory while the GeForce GTX 1050 has just 2GB. When it comes to gaming, this extra memory can come in handy if you want to play at higher resolutions or with more graphical bells and whistles enabled.

The GeForce GTX 1050 also has a higher clock speed than the Radeon RX 480, which can give you a slight edge in performance in some games. On the other hand, AMD’s FreeSync technology might provide a smoother gaming experience when used with compatible monitors.

Ultimately, which card you choose will come down to personal preference and what kinds of games you plan on playing. Both are great options that should provide plenty of performance for the average gamer.
