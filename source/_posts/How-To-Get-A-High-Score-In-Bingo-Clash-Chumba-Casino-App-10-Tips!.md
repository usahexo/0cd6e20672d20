#  How to Nab a Prize in the Bingo Clash Chumba Casino App

On the Bingo Clash Chumba Casino app, the prizes for players are always changing. They could be cash, bonus coins, free spins, or other rewards. The key to winning one of these prizes is to know when and how to nab them.

The first step is to understand what the different prize types are. There are three main types of prizes on the app: bonus coins, free spins, and cash. Bonus coins are just that - bonus coins that can be used in the game for extra chances to win. Free spins are exactly what they sound like: free spins that can be used on the slots games within the app. Cash prizes are, of course, cash prizes that can be withdrawn from your account once they have been won.

The second step is to learn when and how to nab each type of prize. Bonus coins are generally awarded for simply playing the game - the more you play, the more chances you have to win bonus coins. Free spins can be won in a number of ways, including but not limited to: by levelling up (the higher your level, the more free spins you unlock), by earning Achievements (such as completing a certain amount of games in a row), or by opening Chests (containing free spin rewards). Cash prizes can only be won by playing in tournaments; however, smaller cash prizes may also be awarded randomly at any time while playing Bingo Clash or one of the other slots games offered on Chumba Casino.

By following these two steps, you'll increase your chances of winning one of the many different prizes available on the Bingo Clash Chumba Casino app!
